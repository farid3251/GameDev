    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are an indie game development team passionate about creating unique and
        engaging experiences. Our journey began with a love for gaming and a
        desire to bring our ideas to life. What started as a small project has
        grown into a collection of games that combine creativity, storytelling,
        and fun gameplay.<br />
        <br />
        As a team of game enthusiasts, we focus on developing titles that reflect
        our love for the art of gaming while keeping things simple, yet memorable.
        Every project we work on is a reflection of our dedication to crafting
        games that players can enjoy, whether it's for a few minutes or a few
        hours.<br />
        <br />
        Our mission is to make games that leave a lasting impression while
        remaining accessible to all players. We believe in the power of indie
        games to inspire and entertain, and we're excited to share our creations
        with the world.
